## Code to process the HOT3D dataset


## Usage:
Step 1: Follow the instructions at the official repository https://github.com/facebookresearch/hot3d to prepare the environment and download the dataset. You should also enable jupyter because the processing codes are run on jupyter.

Step 2: Set 'dataset_path', 'dataset_processed_path', 'object_library_path', and 'mano_hand_model_path' in 'hot3d_aria_preprocessing.ipynb', put 'hot3d_aria_preprocessing.ipynb', 'hot3d_aria_scene.csv', 'hot3d_objects.csv', and 'utils' into the official repository ('hot3d/hot3d/'), and run it to process the dataset.

Step 3: It is optional but highly recommended to set 'data_path', 'object_library_path', and 'mano_hand_model_path' in 'hot3d_aria_visualisation.ipynb', put 'hot3d_aria_visualisation.ipynb' and 'mano_hand_pose_init' into the official repository ('hot3d/hot3d/'), and run it to visualise and get familiar with the dataset.
